I am a 4th year student in the [Computer Science Department](https://www.uvic.ca/ecs/computerscience/index.php) at the [University of Victoria](https://www.uvic.ca/), due to graduate in January of 2024. My academic experience lies in operating systems, database management systems, data science, theory of computer science, networks, and computer graphics. Via exposure to a broad spectrum of computer science related fields, I have developed a strong interest in machine learning and data science.

Previously I have completed two internships in the summer of 2022, and 2021. My most recent internship at [Elevated Signals](https://www.elevatedsignals.com/) as a Data Science Intern which involved conducting exploratory data analysis via machine learning methodoliges such as [Auto Encoders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoencoder), [Decision Trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree_learning), [Regression Models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis), and [Isolation Forests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isolation_forest). In the summer of 2021 I was a Software Developer Intern at [Styx Intelligence](https://styxintel.com/) where I undertook development of a holistic data collection pipeline. This task was implemeted using AWS tools such as [Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/), [EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/), [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/), and [RDS](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/) along with Python as a core development language.

In my free time I enjoy keeping up with the latest news in machine learning and artificial intelligence, whether it be reading articles, academic papers, watching videos, or listening to podcasts. While I am away from my computer some of my hobbies include mountain biking, skiing, playing guitar, and attempting to produce music.
